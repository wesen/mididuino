Ruin & Wesen Patch Manager
--------------------------

The Patch Manager is a utility to upload firmwares to the MiniCommand.
It connects to the Ruin & Wesen website and checks if new firmwares are 
available.

To upload a firmware to the MiniCommand, connect it to your computer over
MIDI, select a firmware, and press the "Send Patch" button. This will open
a new screen in which you need to configure the input and output MIDI
devices (just for the first time, the Patch Manager remembers your settings).
After pressing Send, the new firmware is uploaded to the device, and is then
ready to use.
